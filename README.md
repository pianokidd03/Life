# Conway's Game of Life in Python ðŸ‘¾

This repo automates [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). 

The `Life/life.py` file handles all the functionality (getting a cell's coordinates, computing the next generation, etc.). The other files are for packaging purposes. 

> The repo is currently avaiable as a Python package on [PyPI's Test site](https://test.pypi.org/project/conway-life-game/).
